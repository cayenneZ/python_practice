the purpose of this setup is so you can do four things very reliably while you work on the
exercises:
1. Write exercises using your text editor, gedit on Linux, TextWrangler on OSX, or Notepad++
on Windows.
2. Run the exercises you wrote.
3. Fix them when they are broken.
4. Repeat.
Anything else will only confuse you, so stick to the plan.
